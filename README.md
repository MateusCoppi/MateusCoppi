Hello, my name is Mateus Coppi, I'm 23 years old, and I'm passionate about technology, data, machine learning, mathematics, and fantasy in the style of Lord of the Rings :)...

Currently, I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in Accounting and taking courses in Data Science, Data Analysis, Statistics, Storytelling, Visualization, and areas related to the world of data.

When I landed my first job in an accounting office, I had the opportunity to delve into the business world and get a taste of Business Intelligence, which greatly interested me and prompted further research on the subject. Through this exploration, I discovered the fascinating universe of data, sparking a keen interest in learning more.

Today, i dedicating myself to personal projects focused on study. Whenever the opportunity arises to apply something I've learned in my current role, I make a point to do so.

I have been committed to my studies, and soon I will delve into Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
